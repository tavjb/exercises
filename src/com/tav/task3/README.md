# Task 3

Write code that transforms an integer list into a
string list with a "number: " string and the number itself

example:

[ 30, -1, -33, 2, -13, 4, 40, 90, 3, -30, -60 ]
-> [ "number: -30", "number: -33", "number: -60" ]


** I know the lesson might have confused you about transforming streams between types,
if you're lost, just look at the answer
